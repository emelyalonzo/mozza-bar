The website of Mozza Bar's restaurant, where you can book a table, check the menu and get in touch with the restaurant staff.

## 🖇 Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
It was asked to do only the structure of the HTML, but to practice I have decided to include Sass for the styles of the desktop version.
It's made with HTML and Sass. It has some cool features like a carousel for the menu, and masonry grid for the gallery of photos.
