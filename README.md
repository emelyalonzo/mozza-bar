## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
The website of Mozza Bar's restaurant, where you can book a table, check the menu and get in touch with the restaurant staff.

## 🖇 Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>
It was asked to do only the structure of the HTML, but to practice I have decided to include Sass for the styles of the desktop version.
It's made with HTML and Sass. It has some cool features like a carousel for the menu, and masonry grid for the gallery of photos.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

It is not uploaded to the web yet, but it is possible to see it through the Live Server plugging of VSCode.

## 💡 Idea <a name = "idea"></a>
It's made from the exercise proposed in the HTML module in the Upgrade Hub web development bootcamp
